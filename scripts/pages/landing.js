    <h1 class="header">Welcome to <a href="#home">Essencials</a></h1>
    <p>Essencials is a tool to track your growth. Use this tool to remind yourself of where you are trying to go and how far you've come.</p>
    <b class="p-header">Affirmations</b>
    <p>Create affirmations on the fly, which are a powerful tool for programming your subconscious. By seeing the same positive affirmations each time you log on, you can change the thought patterns you have on a daily basis.</p>
    <b class="p-header">Budgets</b>
    <p>Create budgets to remind yourself to take and add from different categories of your funds. This is useful for organizing and taking control of your financial life.</p>
    <b class="p-header">Daily Schedule</b>
    <p>Create a daily schedule to map out your day. This can add new level of organization and help you remember to remember.</p>
    <b class="p-header">Goals</b>
    <p>Create goals, much like affirmations, but save your goals forever to see how far you've come and your direction.</p>
    <b class="p-header">Logs</b>
    <p>Create logs to document any useful insights that you'd like to keep and review throughout the day.</p>
